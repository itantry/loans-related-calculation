        <h2>Benefits of Additional Payments</h2>
        <p>Making additional payments towards your home loan can significantly reduce the total interest paid and shorten the loan tenure. By paying more than the required monthly EMI (Equated Monthly Installment), you directly reduce the outstanding principal amount. This leads to a lower interest calculation for subsequent months, as interest is calculated on the remaining principal. Even small additional payments can have a substantial impact over the long term, saving you a considerable amount of money and allowing you to own your home sooner.</p>

        <h2>Understanding the Comparison Table</h2>
        <p>The comparison table feature allows you to compare different loan scenarios side-by-side. This is particularly useful for understanding the impact of various factors, such as interest rate, loan tenure, and additional payments, on your overall loan cost. By comparing different scenarios, you can make informed decisions about your loan strategy and choose the option that best suits your financial goals. For example, you can see how increasing your additional payments or choosing a shorter tenure can affect your monthly EMI and total interest paid.</p>

         <h2>Total Amount of Interest</h2>
        <p>The total amount of interest is a crucial factor to consider when taking out a loan. It represents the total cost of borrowing money, excluding the principal amount. A lower interest rate and shorter loan tenure generally result in a lower total interest paid. By using this calculator and experimenting with different scenarios, you can gain a clear understanding of how the total interest is calculated and how you can minimize it through strategic repayment planning.</p>
